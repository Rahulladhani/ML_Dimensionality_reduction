# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis-LDA-with-Logistic-Regression
This script demonstrates how to apply Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction and then use Logistic Regression for classification on the Wine dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing, applying LDA, training a Logistic Regression model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.

Summary of the Steps:

1 Importing the Libraries: Necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building are imported.

2 Loading the Dataset: The Wine dataset is loaded, and features (X) and labels (y) are extracted.

3 Splitting the Dataset: The data is split into training and test sets.

4 Feature Scaling: Standardization is applied to scale the features.

5 Applying LDA: LDA is performed to reduce the feature dimensions to 2.

6 Training the Model: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the reduced training set.

7 Evaluating the Model: The model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

8 Visualizing the Results: The decision boundaries and results are visualized for both training and test sets.
