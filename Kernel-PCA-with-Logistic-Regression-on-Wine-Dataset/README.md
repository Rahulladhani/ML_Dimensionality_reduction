# Kernel-PCA-with-Logistic-Regression-on-Wine-Dataset

This project applies Kernel Principal Component Analysis (Kernel PCA) to a wine classification dataset and follows up with training a Logistic Regression model. The key steps are:

1 Data Loading and Preprocessing: Import the dataset, split it into training and test sets, and apply feature scaling.

2 Applying Kernel PCA: Reduce the dataset's dimensionality to 2 components using Kernel PCA with an RBF kernel.

3 Model Training: Train a Logistic Regression model on the transformed training set.

4 Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

5 Visualization: Visualize the decision boundary and classification results for both training and test sets.

6 The implementation covers the entire pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.
