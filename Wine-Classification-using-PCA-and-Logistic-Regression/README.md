# Wine-Classification-using-PCA-and-Logistic-Regression
This repository contains a Python script for classifying wine types using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Logistic Regression. The script performs the following steps:

1 Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

2 Load Dataset: Load the wine dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

3 Split Dataset: Split the dataset into training and test sets.

4 Feature Scaling: Standardize the features using StandardScaler

5 Apply PCA: Reduce the dataset's dimensionality to 2 principal components.

6 Train Logistic Regression Model: Train a Logistic Regression classifier on the training set.

7 Evaluate Model: Predict the test set results, generate a confusion matrix, and calculate the 
  accuracy score.

8 Evaluate Model: Predict the test set results, generate a confusion matrix, and calculate the 
  accuracy score.
